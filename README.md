## ‚ö† Attention

This is a fake control center and it build from python so it cann't control the hardware like: Change brightness, sound, turn on/off wifi,....


## ‚ùìIssues
* Basically, i make a dark mode version but the problem is if you want to change themes from Light to Dark mode, you have to do this:
	* Open 'macOS-control-center-for-linux' and go to themes folder, you will see a folder named Light and Dark (Default is dark mode)
	* Open the Light/Dark folder, you will see 2 files
	* Copy all the file in that, then go to folder named 'comicecontrolcenter'
	* Paste the files and replace them
* A bluetooth connection is required for Control Center too. If your system doesn't have bluetooth, please don't try this because it will not work

## For Arch users
When you install this tool, you cann't see wifi connection and bluetooth. To fix it, type this in terminal:
```bash
sudo pacman -S blueman iw
```	

To fix sound doesn't display, type:
```bash
sudo pacman -S pulseaudio-alsa
```
